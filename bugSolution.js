```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/" legacyBehavior>
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about" legacyBehavior>
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This solution utilizes the `legacyBehavior` prop added to the `<Link>` component in Next.js 13+. This prop ensures that the component uses the previous rendering behavior from versions prior to Next.js 13.  This is just one possible solution; others may involve careful review of the client-side hydration process and ensuring consistent behavior between the server and client renders.
