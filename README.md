# Next.js 13+ Link Component Hydration and Strict Mode Issues

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Next.js `<Link>` component in versions 13 and above. The issue centers around hydration and behavior changes introduced in these newer versions, potentially leading to discrepancies between server-side rendering and client-side hydration, particularly when strict mode is enabled. 

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple component using the Next.js `<Link>` component.  In Next.js 12 and earlier, this works as expected, but in Next.js 13+, strict mode can cause unexpected behavior during the initial client-side render (hydration). This can manifest as rendering errors or inconsistencies between the server-rendered output and the client-side hydration.  

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file offers a potential workaround.  The exact solution might depend on the specifics of the issue.  This is illustrative and may need adjustment based on the particular scenario and version of Next.js.
