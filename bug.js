```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code will work fine in Next.js 12, but it might cause issues in Next.js 13+ due to changes in how Next.js handles client-side navigation.  The problem is that the `<Link>` component's behavior is subtly altered in the transition between versions. In Next.js 13+, strict mode may cause unexpected behavior with these links, and they may not be properly handled during the initial client-side render, leading to issues with hydration.
